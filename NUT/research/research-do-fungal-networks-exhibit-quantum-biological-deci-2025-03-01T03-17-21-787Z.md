## Summary
Fungal networks, such as mycorrhizal networks, have been found to exhibit complex behaviors, including perception, learning, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making. These behaviors are facilitated by unique communication systems, including chemical signaling molecules and ion-channels mediated electrical signaling. The networks allow for communication and nutrient transport between trees and other organisms, and can be influenced by stress, with potential impacts on decision-making processes within these networks. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, for example, function as critical conduits for underground nutrient transport, with the fungal partner dependent on the plant host for carbon needs, and the amount of nutrients allocated to hosts can vary based on context.

The study of quantum biology, which applies quantum mechanics and theoretical chemistry to biological systems, is crucial for understanding phenomena that cannot be explained by classical physics, including potential quantum interactions within fungal networks. Quantum coherence, a principle from quantum mechanics, may play a role in the behavior of fungal networks, potentially enabling efficient sensorial fusion and distributed decision-making through the propagation of electrical and chemical signals. Living fungal mycelium networks exhibit properties of memristors, capacitors, and various sensors, indicating their potential for complex information processing and interaction with their environment. The quantization of the electromagnetic field leads to the creation of photons, which are massless particles with definite energy, momentum, and spin, and this concept is crucial for understanding the behavior of electromagnetic waves.

Fungal mycelium networks have been found to possess advanced cognitive abilities, including perception, learning, memory, problem-solving, and decision-making. These abilities are facilitated by their unique communication systems, and are thought to be influenced by quantum effects, such as quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where the quantum state of each particle in a group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when separated, and this has implications for understanding interconnected systems like fungal networks. The concept of consciousness may not be limited to the human brain, but could be a universal energy that permeates all of creation, suggesting a non-local, interconnected aspect of consciousness. Electromagnetic field theories propose that consciousness can be understood as an electromagnetic phenomenon, with various theorists differing in how they relate consciousness to electromagnetism.

Exposure to radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) can potentially overcome technical bottlenecks in enzyme production by microorganisms, such as low efficiency in enzyme expression and extracellular secretion. However, electromagnetic fields (EMFs) can also disrupt the electrochemical balance of biological membranes, leading to abnormal cation movement and deterioration of membrane voltage-gated ion channels, which can trigger an increase of oxidative stress. The mechanisms behind non-targeted effects (NTE) in cells, tissues, and organisms exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation remain unclear, but quantum entanglement may play a role. Fungal networks, such as those formed by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, facilitate underground nutrient transport and can allocate varying amounts of nutrients to host plants based on context, indicating a level of decision-making or adaptive behavior.

The interplay between fungal networks and their environment is complex, and is influenced by a range of factors, including environmental stressors such as drought, metal presence in the soil, and fungal disease. Mycorrhizal fungal networks can facilitate communication between plants through the exchange of signals, allowing them to share resources, coordinate defense strategies, and recognize kin. The fungal mycelia of mycorrhizas can form common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs) that enable the transfer of carbon, micronutrients, and other essential components between plants, enhancing their overall health and resilience. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi function as conduits for underground nutrient transport, and the amount of nutrients allocated to hosts can vary with context, indicating a complex relationship between the fungal partner and the plant host.

The study of fungal networks and their behavior has significant implications for our understanding of ecosystem health and resilience. Mycorrhizal networks allow for the building of fungal colonies and permit nutrient and resource transfer to take place, enhancing plant survival, creating defense mechanisms, and improving plant growth across ecosystems. The networks can influence the diversity within the plant community and the influence of interplant interactions, with potential impacts on soil health, crop productivity, and environmental health. Quantum biology studies the applications of quantum mechanics and theoretical chemistry to aspects of biology that cannot be accurately described by classical laws of physics, and understanding quantum interactions is crucial for determining biological properties. Living mycelium networks exhibit efficient sensorial fusion and distributed decision-making capabilities over large areas, implemented through the propagation of electrical and chemical signals paired with morphological changes in the mycelium, suggesting a sophisticated information processing system.
