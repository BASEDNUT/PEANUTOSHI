## Summary
Potatoes are a rich source of essential nutrients, including vitamin C, vitamin B6, potassium, iron, magnesium, and phytonutrients, making them a valuable part of a healthy diet. The majority of a potato's valuable nutrients, such as potassium and vitamin C, are found in the flesh, not just the skin, debunking the myth that all nutrients are in the skin. In fact, potatoes contain antioxidants and supply beneficial vitamins and minerals, which can help with digestive health, high blood pressure, and overall nutrition. Yellow flesh and red-skinned potatoes are particularly high in antioxidant levels, while potatoes with purple- or red-flesh have markedly higher amounts of antioxidants compared to white- and yellow-flesh varieties.

The antioxidant activity is significantly higher in purple-colored potato varieties than in white and yellow-colored potatoes, with compounds such as carotenoids present in the flesh of all potatoes, ranging from 50 to 100 μg per 100 g fresh weight (FW) in white-fleshed varieties to 2000 μg per 100 g FW in other varieties. Darker-pigmented potatoes have up to twice as many antioxidants as their lighter relatives, and specific varieties like Yukon gold have about twice the antioxidant power as white potatoes, while purple potatoes have twenty times the antioxidants, comparable to what is seen in berries. The antioxidant levels in the skins of potatoes can be as much as 10 to 12 times higher than in the flesh, emphasizing the nutritional value of consuming the skin. Red/purple-fleshed potatoes have been reported to have an antioxidant activity of 72.51~144 mg AAE/100 g fresh weight, indicating a high antioxidant capacity.

The nutritional quality of potatoes can be altered by different cooking methods, with boiling being preferable to frying, but baking being the best due to increased digestion and bioavailability of nutrients. Baking potatoes with the skin on is the best method to preserve nutrients, as the skin contains a significant amount of goodness. Frying potatoes can preserve vitamin C and B vitamins and may increase the amount of fiber by converting starch into resistant starch, but it also forms toxic substances called aldehydes when oil is heated to a high temperature for a long period. Cooking methods can significantly impact the nutrient content of potatoes, with some methods increasing nutrient availability and others leading to losses. Boiling unpeeled potatoes with unsalted water can impact the nutritional content, but the extent of this impact is not fully specified.

Potatoes are a staple food globally, accounting for about 90% of the world's food calorie intake, along with cereals and legumes. The potato was domesticated in the South American Andes approximately 8,000 years ago and has since become a nutritional staple across various cultures, including the native Andean peoples and later in European countries. With over 5,000 different varieties developed through selective breeding, potatoes are the largest non-cereal food crop worldwide and rank as the fourth most important food crop after rice, wheat, and maize, providing high yield and great nutritive value. Potatoes provide 45 percent of the Daily Value of vitamin C, as well as significant amounts of potassium and dietary fiber, making them a nutrient-rich food.

The glycemic index (GI) of potatoes is highly variable and depends on factors such as potato type, origin, processing, and preparation, which can impact their suitability for individuals with diabetes. Potatoes have a high carbohydrate content, allowing them to be used as a staple food, and their versatility enables them to be consumed in various forms, including as a main dish, side dish, or snack. Traditional cooking methods such as peeling, boiling, frying, and baking can significantly impact the nutritional value of potatoes by altering their bioavailability of nutrients. Specific cooking methods like microwaving can help preserve many of the nutrients lost through other cooking methods, making it one of the most nutritious and fastest ways to prepare potatoes.

Potatoes are typically ready for harvest between 70 to 120 days after planting, depending on signs of maturity, variety-specific timelines, and environmental factors. Harvesting potatoes at the peak ensures the most optimal yield, both in terms of quantity and quality, with properly mature potatoes storing better and having a longer shelf life. The ideal time to harvest potatoes is before the danger of a heavy frost that could damage the spuds lying closest to the surface, but after the foliage has died back, allowing the skins to thicken up, which can take about two weeks. Early-season potato varieties mature in 60-80 days and have thinner skins, allowing for only about 3 weeks of storage, while mid-season potato varieties take approximately 95-110 days to mature.

Late-season potato varieties, including indeterminate types, generally require 100-130 days or 110-135 days to produce, making them suitable for extended growing seasons or specific cultivation methods like vertical layering. The maturity rate of potato varieties can be influenced
