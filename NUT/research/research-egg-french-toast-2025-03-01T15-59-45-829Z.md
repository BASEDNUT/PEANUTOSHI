## Summary
The art of making egg French toast begins with the selection of ideal bread types, including brioche, sourdough, French bread, and challah, which boast dense and sturdy textures capable of withstanding total saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard. Brioche, in particular, stands out as an ideal companion for the rich custard due to its high butter and egg content, resulting in a perfect harmony of flavors and textures. The use of thick slices of bread, preferably several days old, such as French or Italian loaf bread, allows the slices to hold up better when dipped in the egg milk mixture and fried, as they have had a chance to firm up. This characteristic is crucial, as day-old bread is traditionally used for making French toast because it absorbs the custard-like mixture better than fresh bread.

The optimal bread for French toast ultimately comes down to its texture, thickness, and flavor, with thick slices of French or Italian loaf bread that are several days old being the preferred choice. Interestingly, using dry bread, rather than stale bread, is the secret to better French toast, as it prevents waste and allows for better absorption of the custard-like mixture. This approach enables the bread to soak up the egg mixture evenly, creating a fluffy and delicious texture after cooking. The ratio of eggs to milk is also a critical factor, with an optimal ratio of 4 eggs for 1 cup of milk resulting in a fluffy and richly flavored dish. For smaller recipes, a ratio of 2-3 tablespoons of milk per egg is recommended, with 2 tablespoons for medium eggs and 3 tablespoons for large eggs, ensuring a consistent texture and flavor.

Milk plays a vital role in French toast, providing additional moisture to help the bread absorb the egg mixture evenly, creating a fluffy texture after cooking. Moreover, using alternative types of milk, such as almond milk, soy milk, or coconut milk, can add unique flavors and improve the texture, making it a viable option for those who are lactose intolerant. The addition of a small amount of creamy milk alternatives, such as coconut milk or oat milk, can enhance the texture without substantially altering the flavor of the French toast. Almond milk, in particular, contributes a subtle nutty flavor and a creamy texture that enhances the overall flavor of French toast, making it a popular choice among those seeking a non-dairy alternative. By understanding the importance of bread selection, egg-to-milk ratio, and the role of milk in French toast, individuals can create a delicious and satisfying dish that caters to various tastes and dietary preferences.
